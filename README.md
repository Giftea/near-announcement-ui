# Getting Started with Near Announcement


Near Announcement allows a user who has access to the application to make announcements. These announcements have particular functionalities, such as the ability to make an announcement and then have people leave an impression on it. The announcement may elicit positive(like) or negative(dislike) reactions. No user can produce the same impression twice; it has to be a positive or negative one. Also, in order to make an announcement, you must pay 0.52 near tokens, which prevents users from spamming the application.
